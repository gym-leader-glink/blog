[{"categories":["Health","Fitness","Lifestyle"],"contents":"This one is personally a bit painful to write, because due to the global pandemic all gyms are currently closed and we\u0026rsquo;re pretty much stuck with our home workouts üòÖ. However, that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t stop us from reaching our fitness or health goals! üí™üèº\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m going to go explain my own personal approach on how I deal with this.\nMeasurement and Goals üèÅ If you are a beginner, I would say this is the most important thing to do first. Everybody has different body and by consequence different fitness goals. Yours could be mass gain, weight loss, or overall health and maintenance.\nMeasuring a starting point is very important, it will do a few things for you:\n Tell you in what direction to go. Either gain, loss, maintenance. Motivate you as you progress in the future. Tell you if you are actually making progress. If progress is not happening, changes or tweaks on your routine will have to be made.  A few tools I\u0026rsquo;ve found helpful for measuring and setting goals:\n How to split your meals with a macros calculator Knowing how many calories you need to consume with a calories calculator A food calculator, to know exactly what nutrients are in the food that you\u0026rsquo;re eating  When it comes to goals, a personal favorite \u0026ndash; set the bar high. My own goal was that I wanted to get to a \u0026ldquo;Wolverine\u0026rdquo; level to attend any Halloween party as Logan üéÉ. I still haven\u0026rsquo;t quite reached it but see\u0026hellip; the thing is not really about the goal itself, but to have something \u0026ndash; anything \u0026ndash; to reach out for!\nCreate a Routine - The Push/Pull Split I\u0026rsquo;ve found this method to work best because your muscles need time to rest and grow between workouts.\nThe basic concept is to split push and pull exercises by days. So that each muscle group has at least 2 days of rest between the next workout.\nMy own personal routine is the following, but can be changed, in fact I change it myself from time to time to keep it interesting.\n Monday: Chest + Shoulders (push) Tuesday: Back and Biceps (pull) Wednesday: Legs + Abs Workout Thursday: Chest + Triceps (push) Friday: Back + Biceps or Forearms (pull) Saturday: Legs + Abs Workout Sunday: Rest Day! üí§  I\u0026rsquo;ll go in depth on each day on a different post. For now, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about the most what you\u0026rsquo;ll be needing\nEquipment Before the pandemic started, I was never doing home workouts so I had to adapt.\nIf there was a single piece of equipment I would recommend, it would 100% be a set of resistance bands (As shown on the top picture of the post). I was pleasantly surprised on how good they can actually be and how much variety these can provide.\nNote: If you do decide buying some, make sure that the set you purchase has ideally handles and a door anchor.\nConsistency Sleep. Workout. Eat. Repeat.\nGuys, this is very important. No matter how hard you\u0026rsquo;re training, how good you\u0026rsquo;re eating, or how good you\u0026rsquo;re well \u0026ndash; sleeping. If you are not consistent with the routine you created. Remember that the worst workout is that one you don\u0026rsquo;t do!\nMusic Last but not least.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny how all the blogs or videos I\u0026rsquo;ve seen nobody is mentioning music! Honestly, it is really important for you to pick the right music to work out. It puts you immediately on the mood to move!\nEveryone has different taste on this, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to list a few of my own personal favorites here:\n   ","permalink":"https://gym.leader.glink.blog/the-home-workout/","tags":["At Home"],"title":"The Home Workout"},{"categories":null,"contents":"or you can call me Gabriel. I\u0026rsquo;m a software egineer originally from Honduras in Latin America living in Berlin, Germany. Things I love include gaming, having a healthy lifestyle, working out, dogs and photography. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working out consistently over the past 4 years and am writing this blog from the perspective of a \u0026ldquo;normal working\u0026rdquo; person with the goal of keeping it as real as possible and to share everything I can.\n","permalink":"https://gym.leader.glink.blog/about/","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"categories":["Health","Fitness","Food"],"contents":"You probably have your easy go-to breakfast for when you wanted some extra sleep or something that requires no thought to put together. I totally get it \u0026ndash; I have one too! I\u0026rsquo;ll most likely talk about that one on a different blog post, however today is the day of the Pancake! ü•û\nI mean think about it, everybody loves pancakes right? At least I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t. The good thing is that with some small tweaks to the usual recipe, you can make perfectly healthy and a powerful breakfast üí™üèº.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with two of the basics. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably talk about this a lot on my blog\u0026hellip; sugar and general purpose flour‚ùóÔ∏è\nGenerally speaking, I try to avoid sugar at all costs . When consumed in excess, sugar causes your hormones to fluctuate in unnatural ways, cause your insulin levels to spike, and it is a source of calories that don\u0026rsquo;t really provide much any sort of significant nutrition.\nNow when it comes to white flour\u0026hellip; is made out of refined grains which in turn mean simple carbs and gluten in your foods. It has no fiber, slows downs digestion which creates a sluggish metabolism, that can lead to weight gain. Carbs are not the enemy, in fact Oats are a source of complex carbs that provide excellent nutrition. The key is to choose the right one ‚úÖ.\nThe Oat üåæ Oats are among the healthiest grains on earth \u0026ndash; it\u0026rsquo;s literally the first thing I recommend anyone to incorporate into their diet, and my blog is no exception!\n Oats are incredibly nutritious. They are a good source of complex carbs and fiber \u0026ndash; gluten free! No blood sugar spikes  The Banana üçå Bananas are extremely healthy, tasty and probably one of the most popular fruits in the world! Remember I mentioned to avoid sugars at all cost? Well I\u0026rsquo;m not going to let you all sad in a corner.. from now on you can think of bananas as a great replacement of sugar for most of baking and cooking.\nThe Milk ü•õ I think normal cow whole milk is an easy source of calories when you\u0026rsquo;re bulking up, however I find it harder for the body to digest. So I would recommend going for either oat or almond milk. In terms of flavor and consistency, oat milk is the one that resembles the most to cow‚Äôs milk.\nThe Egg ü•ö Well what can I say about eggs, if you have seen some bodybuilders gulping raw eggs out there then there must be a reason right? As a matter of fact eggs are among the most nutritious foods in the planet. If I had to make a post about \u0026ldquo;superfoods\u0026rdquo;, eggs would be definitely listed there.\nThe Oil ü´íü•• I\u0026rsquo;d stick with either coconut or olive oil. For pancakes however, I personally prefer the taste of coconut! They both have their own benefits so I like to balance switch between them on my foods.\nThe Pancake ü•ûüçØ Jeez can we eat already I\u0026rsquo;m starving \u0026ndash; that\u0026rsquo;s literally me every morning. The reason I like this type of pancake is because is basically mixing up all good stuff in and putting it in a frying pan. So let\u0026rsquo;s do just that!\nYou can vary the quantities depending on your goals, if you are counting macros and so on, but I\u0026rsquo;ll list a more balanced recipe here.\n Take out your blender. üë®üèº‚Äçüç≥ Add 1 cup of oats Add 3 eggs Add 1 chopped banana, ripped bananas will give you a more sweet taste and are preferable for pancakes. Add 1 cup of your milk of choice (optional) Add your favorite whey protein powder, also gives an extra flavor to your pancakes. (optional) Add some chia seeds and nuts to the mix Once you blend it all together, you need to add 1 teaspoon of coconut oil on a frying pan and cook your pancakes as you would normally do. You can now add some toppings like a little bit of natural honey or blueberries or raspberries. Enjoy!
