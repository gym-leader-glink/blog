Oats Benefits •\tOats are loaded with dietary fiber (containing more than many other grains) and have a range of healthy cholesterol-lowering properties. •\tEating foods rich in whole-oat sources of soluble fiber (oats, oat bran, and oat flour) may help reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, by significantly reducing total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (LDL cholesterol, “bad” cholesterol) without affecting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (HDL cholesterol, “good” cholesterol). •\ta lower risk of colorectal cancer. With a high intake of dietary fibre, most importantly, whole grains and cereals, the risk of colorectal cancer decreases. •\tA diet that includes good amounts of whole grains (like oats and wholemeal bread) with at least three portions per day is as effective as taking anti-hypertensive medication for lowering blood pressure. •\tThe fiber in oats helps keep the gastrointestinal tract running smoothly, reducing constipation. Researchers suggest potential health effects ranging from improved immune health to reducing the risk of obesity and chronic disease. Also, evidence suggests that regular consumption of whole-grain foods may be correlated with lower body mass index (BMI). The researchers state that eating oats appears to help reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness. •\tOats contain a range of molecules that act as antioxidants.  Nutrition Dietary fiber — oats are rich in a specific type of fiber called beta-glucan. This particular type of fiber is known to help lower levels of bad cholesterol. One cup (81 grams) of dry oats contains 7.5 grams of fiber, the recommended daily intake of fiber is 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. Minerals — oats are rich in a range of important minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. Just 100 grams of oats contain: •\t51 percent of the daily recommended intake of thiamine •\t8 percent riboflavin •\t5 percent niacin •\t6 percent vitamin B6 •\t14 percent folate •\t13 percent pantothenic acid •\t26 percent iron •\t44 percent magnesium •\t52 percent phosphorus •\t12 percent potassium •\t26 percent zinc •\t31 percent copper •\t246 percent manganese Calories — one cup of dry oats (80g) contains approximately 297 calories.\nBanana Benefits •\tBananas contain a fair amount of fiber, as well as several antioxidants. One medium-sized banana (118 grams) also boasts: •\tPotassium: 9% of the RDI (Recommended Dietary Intake) •\tVitamin B6: 33% of the RDI •\tVitamin C: 11% of the RDI •\tMagnesium: 8% of the RDI •\tCopper: 10% of the RDI •\tManganese: 14% of the RDI •\tNet carbs: 24 grams •\tFiber: 3.1 grams •\tProtein: 1.3 grams •\tFat: 0.4 grams •\tEach banana has only about 105 calories and consists almost exclusively of water and carbs. Bananas hold very little protein and almost no fat. Eating more fiber from vegetables and fruits like bananas has repeatedly been linked to lower body weight and weight loss. •\tBoth pectin and resistant starch may moderate blood sugar levels after meals and reduce appetite by slowing the emptying of your stomach. •\tFurthermore, bananas also rank low to medium on the glycemic index (GI), which is a measure — from 0–100 — of how quickly foods increase blood sugar levels. •\tThe GI value of unripe bananas is about 30, while ripe bananas rank at about 60. The average value of all bananas is 51 •\tThis means that bananas should not cause major spikes in blood sugar levels in healthy individuals. •\tGreat source of potassium. A potassium-rich diet can help lower blood pressure, and people who eat plenty of potassium have up to a 27% lower risk of heart disease and help maintain healthy kidneys. •\tInsulin resistance is a major risk factor for many of the world’s most serious diseases, including type 2 diabetes. Several studies reveal that 15–30 grams of resistant starch per day may improve insulin sensitivity by 33–50% in as few as four weeks. Unripe bananas are a great source of resistant starch. Therefore, they may help improve insulin sensitivity. •\tBananas may help relieve muscle cramps caused by exercise. They also provide excellent fuel for endurance exercise.  Oat Milk or Almond Milk? •\tOat Milk: In terms of flavor and consistency, oat milk is the one that resembles the most to cow’s milk. •\tSustainibility: As almond trees require a lot of water to produce almonds, oats require a lot of land to produce oat milk, which is more eco friendly than the other alternative milk. •\tOat milk is mostly water, but it does contain fiber and a small portion of protein. •\tAlmond milk: Almond milk contains trace amounts of protein and vitamin E from the almonds, which are higher than in oats. It is also lower in sugar and calories. (AM 30cal, OM 60cal) •\tAlmond milk is higher in healthy fats (for brain health) than oat milk.  Chia Seeds •\tOne tablespoon (tbsp) of chia seeds contains about 69 calories, as well as, roughly: •\t2 grams (g) protein •\t5 g fat (1 g saturated, 7 g polyunsaturated, 1 g monounsaturated, and 0 g trans) •\t6 g carbs •\t5 g fiber •\tChia seeds also contain a number of vitamins and minerals. One tbsp offers: •\t2 milligrams (mg) phosphorus (about 11 percent of an adult’s recommended daily value, or DV) •\t7 mg calcium (8 percent of DV) •\t8 mg potassium (1 percent of DV) •\t2 mg phosphorus (11 percent of DV) •\t5 IU vitamin A •\t2 mg vitamin C (1 percent of DV) •\t1 mg vitamin E (1 percent of DV) •\tThe fiber in chia seeds aid the digestive system and can also benefit people suffering from health issues such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, depression and when taken regularly in your diet, reduce the risk of heart disease.  Coconut Oil •\tCoconut oil can aid in lowering obesity levels in the body and also battles insulin resistance - issues that often lead to type two diabetes. •\tSince coconut oil is so high in saturated fats, that helps boost HDL (or \u0026quot;good\u0026quot;) cholesterol to ward off heart disease and lowering high triglycerides. Additionally, coconut oil also performs a rather remarkable and heart-healthy feat - it helps turn bad cholesterol into good cholesterol. •\tUnrefined coconut oil also hikes energy and endurance, primarily by its MCFA's shooting directly into the liver, which enables it to be converted into energy and protects the liver from any damage. It also aids in curing urinary tract infections. •\tAnother benefit of coconut oil - it helps with food digestion by aid the body take in fat-soluble components like vitamins and magnesium. It also eliminates toxic bacteria and candida, which fights poor digestion and stomach inflammation. That helps prevent stomach ulcers.
