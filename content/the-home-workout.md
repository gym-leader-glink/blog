This one is personally a bit painful to write, because due to the global pandemic all gyms are currently closed and we're pretty much stuck with our home workouts üòÖ. However, that shouldn't stop us from reaching our fitness or health goals! üí™üèº

So I'm going to go explain my own personal approach on how I deal with this.

### Measurement and Goals üèÅ

If you are a beginner, I would say this is the most important thing to do first. Everybody has different body and by consequence different fitness goals. Yours could be mass gain, weight loss, or overall health and maintenance.

Measuring a starting point is very important, it will do a few things for you:
- Tell you in what direction to go. Either gain, loss, maintenance.
- Motivate you as you progress in the future.
- Tell you if you are actually making progress. If progress is not happening, changes or tweaks on your routine will have to be made.

A few tools I've found helpful for measuring and setting goals:
- How to split your meals with a [macros calculator](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutrients_calculator.htm)
- Knowing how many calories you need to consume with a [calories calculator](https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/macronutcal.htm)
- A [food calculator](https://www.webmd.com/diet/healthtool-food-calorie-counter), to know exactly what nutrients are in the food that you're eating

When it comes to goals, a personal favorite -- **set the bar high**.
My own goal was that I wanted to get to a "Wolverine" level to attend any Halloween party as Logan üéÉ.
I still haven't quite reached it but see... the thing is not really about the goal itself, but to have something -- anything -- to reach out for!

### Create a Routine - The Push/Pull Split

I've found this method to work best because your muscles need time to rest and grow between workouts.

The basic concept is to split push and pull exercises by days. So that each muscle group has at least 2 days of rest between the next workout.

My own personal routine is the following, but can be changed, in fact I change it myself from time to time to keep it interesting.

- Monday: Chest + Shoulders (push)
- Tuesday: Back and Biceps (pull)
- Wednesday: Legs + Abs Workout
- Thursday: Chest + Triceps (push)
- Friday: Back + Biceps or Forearms (pull)
- Saturday: Legs + Abs Workout
- Sunday: Rest Day! üí§

I'll go in depth on each day on a different post. For now, I'll talk about the most what you'll be needing

### Equipment
Before the pandemic started, I was never doing home workouts so I had to adapt.

If there was a single piece of equipment I would recommend, it would 100% be a set of resistance bands (As shown on the top picture of the post). I was pleasantly surprised on how good they can actually be and how much variety these can provide.

**Note:**
If you do decide buying some, make sure that the set you purchase has ideally handles and a door anchor.

### Consistency

Sleep. Workout. Eat. Repeat.

Guys, this is very important. No matter how hard you're training, how good you're eating, or how good you're well -- sleeping. If you are not consistent with the routine you created. Remember that the worst workout is that one you don't do!

### Music

Last but not least.

It's funny how all the blogs or videos I've seen nobody is mentioning music! Honestly, it is really important for you to pick the right music to work out. It puts you immediately on the mood to move!

Everyone has different taste on this, but I'm going to list a few of my own personal favorites here:
