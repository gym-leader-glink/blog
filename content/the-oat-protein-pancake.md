You probably have your easy go-to breakfast for when you wanted some extra sleep or something that requires no thought to put together. I totally get it -- I have one too! I'll most likely talk about that one on a different blog post, however today is the day of the Pancake! 🥞

I mean think about it, everybody loves pancakes right? At least I've never heard someone who doesn't. The good thing is that with some small tweaks to the usual recipe, you can make perfectly healthy and a powerful breakfast 💪🏼.

Let's start with two of the basics. I'll probably talk about this a lot on my blog... **sugar** and **general purpose flour**❗️

Generally speaking, I try to avoid sugar at all costs  . When consumed in excess, sugar causes your hormones to fluctuate in unnatural ways, cause your insulin levels to spike, and it is a source of calories that don't really provide much any sort of significant nutrition.

Now when it comes to white flour... is made out of refined grains which in turn mean simple carbs and gluten in your foods. It has no fiber, slows downs digestion which creates a sluggish metabolism, that can lead to weight gain. Carbs are not the enemy, in fact Oats are a source of complex carbs that provide excellent nutrition. The key is to choose the right one  ✅.

### The Oat 🌾
Oats are among the healthiest grains on earth -- it's literally the first thing I recommend anyone to incorporate into their diet, and my blog is no exception!

- Oats are incredibly nutritious.
- They are a good source of complex carbs and fiber -- gluten free!
- No blood sugar spikes

### The Banana 🍌
Bananas are extremely healthy, tasty and probably one of the most popular fruits in the world!
Remember I mentioned to avoid sugars at all cost? Well I'm not going to let you all sad in a corner.. from now on you can think of bananas as a great replacement of sugar for most of baking and cooking.

### The Milk 🥛
I think normal cow whole milk is an easy source of calories when you're bulking up, however I find it harder for the body to digest. So I would recommend going for either oat or almond milk.
In terms of flavor and consistency, oat milk is the one that resembles the most to cow’s milk.

### The Egg 🥚
Well what can I say about eggs, if you have seen some bodybuilders gulping raw eggs out there then there must be a reason right? As a matter of fact eggs are among the most nutritious foods in the planet. If I had to make a post about "superfoods", eggs would be definitely listed there.

### The Oil 🫒🥥
I'd stick with either coconut or olive oil. For pancakes however, I personally prefer the taste of coconut! They both have their own benefits so I like to balance switch between them on my foods.

### The Pancake 🥞🍯

Jeez can we eat already I'm starving -- that's literally me every morning.
The reason I like this type of pancake is because is basically mixing up all good stuff in and putting it in a frying pan. So let's do just that!

You can vary the quantities depending on your goals, if you are counting macros and so on, but I'll list a more balanced recipe here.

1. Take out your blender. 👨🏼‍🍳
2. Add 1 cup of oats
3. Add 3 eggs
4. Add 1 chopped banana, ripped bananas will give you a more sweet taste and are preferable for pancakes.
5. Add 1 cup of your milk of choice
6. (optional) Add your favorite whey protein powder, also gives an extra flavor to your pancakes.
7. (optional) Add some chia seeds and nuts to the mix
8. Once you blend it all together, you need to add 1 teaspoon of coconut oil on a frying pan and cook your pancakes as you would normally do.
9. You can now add some toppings like a little bit of natural honey or blueberries or raspberries.
10. Enjoy!
