or you can call me Gabriel. I'm a software egineer originally from Honduras in Latin America living in Berlin, Germany. Things I love include gaming, having a healthy lifestyle, working out, dogs and photography.
I've been working out consistently over the past 4 years and am writing this blog from the perspective of a "normal working" person with the goal of keeping it as real as possible and to share everything I can.
